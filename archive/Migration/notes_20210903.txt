migration notes: 
I made pg12 branches of every app, but then I deleted the branch for the gso-coord app since that does not access mars db, only cityworks

created these tables: 
fieldwork.ow_prefixes, 
fieldwork.site_name_lookup
fieldwork.sensor_purpose_lookup (formerly deployment_lookup)
fieldwork.gswi_conveyance_subtype_lookup

added the query/write to the R script with all of those; 


here are views I identified that need to be made in pg12
